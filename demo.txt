One of the most pleasant festivals in India is Diwali. This ‘festival of lights’ falls in October or November in the last days of the dark quarter of the moon. The rainy season is over and everyone is in a festive mood.

Diwali is celebrated in honour of Ram’s victory over Ravana and Krishna’s killing of Narakasura. It indicates the victory of good over evil and knowledge GReet over ignorance.

Diwali lasts five days. These days of rejoicing and worship bring happiness to every house. People clean and decorate their houses and at night both houses and streets are lit up with lights. They prepare sweetmeats at home, wear new dresses and greet relatives and friends. Young and old burst crackers and display fireworks. People from different communities meet each other, give good wishes and that adds to our composite culture and harmony. It also promotes our national integration.

On the day of ‘Laxmi Pooja’ traders start their new account books and worship Goddess Laxmi. ‘Pratipada’ is the beginning of the Hindu new year. On ‘Bhai Dooj’ brothers meet sisters and give gifts to each other.

The spirit of the festival overcomes all the difficulties, at least for these and makes the atmosphere healthy and invigorating.

In future, too, the festival will be celebrated with the same vigour and pleasure, but let us not forget the noise and air pollution caused by the fireworks. The new generation will definitely protect our environment.

The spirit of the festival overcomes all the difficulties, at least for these and makes the atmosphere healthy and invigorating. I love this festival the most. On the day of ‘Laxmi Pooja’ traders start their new account books and worship Goddess Laxmi. ‘Pratipada’ is the beginning of the Hindu new year. On ‘Bhai Dooj’ brothers meet sisters and give gifts to each other.
